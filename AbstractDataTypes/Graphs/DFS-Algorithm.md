# Depth First Search (DFS)

The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, or backtracking.
Here, the word backtrack means that when you are moving forward, and there are no more nodes along the current path, you move backward on the same path to find nodes to traverse. All the nodes will be visited on the current path till all the unvisited nodes have been traversed, after which the following way will be selected.
This recursive nature of DFS can be implemented using stacks. The basic idea is as follows:

* Pick a starting node and push all its adjacent nodes into a stack.
* Pop a node from the stack to select the next node to visit and push all its adjacent nodes into a stack.

Repeat this process until the stack is empty. However, make sure that the nodesw, we have visited are marked. That will prevent you from visiting the same node more than once. If you do not keep the nodes that are seen and you visit the same node more than once, you may end up in an infinite loop.

**Pseudocode**
```c
    DFS-iterative (G, s):                                   //Where G is graph and s is source vertex
      let S be stack
      S.push( s )            //Inserting s in stack 
      mark s as visited.
      while ( S is not empty):
          //Pop a vertex from stack to visit next
          v  =  S.top( )
         S.pop( )
         //Push all the neighbours of v in stack that are not visited   
        for all neighbours w of v in Graph G:
            if w is not visited :
                     S.push( w )         
                    mark w as visited


    DFS-recursive(G, s):
        mark s as visited
        for all neighbours w of s in Graph G:
            if w is not visited:
                DFS-recursive(G, w)
```

Time complexity **O(V+E)** , when implemented using an adjacency list.

***How to find connected components using DFS?***

A graph is said to be disconnected if it is not connected, i.e., if two nodes exist in the chart such that there is no edge between those nodes. In an undirected graph, a connected component is a set of vertices linked to each other by paths.

Consider the example given in the diagram. Graph G is a disconnected graph and has the following three connected components.

* The first connected component is 1 -> 2 -> 3 as they are linked to each other
* Second connected component 4 -> 5
* The third connected component is vertex 6

In DFS, if we start from a start node, it will mark all the nodes connected to the start node as visited. Therefore, if we choose any node in a connected component and run DFS on that node, it will mark the corresponding part as visited.
